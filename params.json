Tinia is a C++ platform designed to make it easy creating applications that can run both on desktops and on servers, potentially in the cloud. It is primarily focused on applications doing rendering with OpenGL and compute intensive programs using CUDA/OpenCL, but it can be used for most any application area.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between a cloud application and a desktop application is just a few lines of code. This means the applications can be developed with all the usual debugging tools available on the desktop, making sure the program is running as it should before deploying on your servers.\r\n\r\nWe are currently finalizing our first public release - stay tuned.\r\n\r\n[Public API docs](http://doc.tinia.org) are now online!\r\n\r\nSee it in action on our [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/Hetcomp).","name":"Tinia"}
