Tinia Mainpage {#mainpage}
==============

Tinia is a C++ platform designed to make it easy creating applications that can
run both on desktops and on servers, potentially in the cloud. It is primarily
focused on applications doing rendering with OpenGL and compute intensive
programs using CUDA/OpenCL, but it can be used for most any application area.

The only difference between a cloud application and a desktop application is
just a few lines of code. This means the applications can be developed with all
the usual debugging tools available on the desktop, making sure the program is
running as it should before deploying on your servers.

See [the compilation instructions](@ref sec_compilation) for details on how to
compile and install the framework.

The documentation is split in the following parts
 - \subpage sec_modules "Components" for a less than detailed description of the individual components

 - \subpage sec_tutorials "Tutorials" for a collection of tutorials on how to use Tinia.
