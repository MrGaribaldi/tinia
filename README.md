Tinia - A cloud platform for accelerated computing and rendering
================================================================

Tinia is a C++ platform designed to make it easy creating applications that can
run both on desktops and on servers, potentially in the cloud. It is primarily
focused on applications doing rendering with OpenGL and compute intensive
programs using CUDA/OpenCL, but it can be used for most any application area.

The only difference between a cloud application and a desktop application is
just a few lines of code. This means the applications can be developed with all
the usual debugging tools available on the desktop, making sure the program is
running as it should before deploying on your servers.


Compilation and installation instructions are available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/sintefmath/tinia/wiki/Compilation-instructions), the ones on www.tinia.org are unfortunately outdated.

The API-reference and tutorials is available at http://doc.tinia.org
